SimpleContract
Overview
SimpleContract is a Solidity smart contract designed to demonstrate basic functionality on the Ethereum blockchain. It provides a simple example of how to deploy and interact with a smart contract using Truffle and Ganache.

Features
hello(): A public function that returns a string "Hello, world!".
verifyData(uint256 data): A public function that takes a uint256 as input and returns a boolean value based on a simple condition.
Getting Started
Install Dependencies: Ensure you have Node.js and npm installed. Then, install Truffle and Ganache CLI:
npm install -g truffle
npm install -g ganache-cli
npm install
ganache-cli
truffle compile
truffle migrate --network development
truffle console --network development
const SimpleContract = artifacts.require("SimpleContract");
const instance = await SimpleContract.deployed();
const greeting = await instance.hello();
console.log(greeting); // Should output: "Hello, world!"
const verification = await instance.verifyData(123);
console.log(verification); // Should output: true or false based on the input
